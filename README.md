# AskforFlags
This is a Python repository for asking Permanent Missions to the United Nations for flags and freebies.

To be able to use it you must personalize it as you want, and you must also add the necessary information required in the code.

It is important that in line 19 you change test.txt to PMUN.txt after you have tried it and that it has worked so that you can send directly to the emails of the permanent missions.
